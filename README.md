## Digital Tech Tutorial Watson Studio Part I to IV

This tutorial consists of 4 parts, you can start with part I or any other part, however, the necessary environment is set up in part I.<br>
[Part I - data visualization, preparation, and transformation](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio)<br>
[Part II - build and evaluate machine learning models by using the AutoAI](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio-part-ii/)<br>
[Part III - graphically build and evaluate machine learning models by using the SPSS Modeler flow](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio-part-iii/)<br>
[Part IV](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio-part-iv/)

The 4 parts of this tutorial are based on the [Learning path: Getting started with Watson Studio](https://developer.ibm.com/series/learning-path-watson-studio/).

## Create model flow

To create an initial machine learning flow:

1. From the Assets page, click Add to project.
2. In the Choose asset type page, select Modeler Flow.

3. On the Modeler page, select the ‘From File’ tab.
4. Download the model flow that is named ‘customer-churn-flow.str’ from this repository.
5. Drag the downloaded modeler flow file to the upload area or browse for it. This also sets the name for the flow.

6. Change the name and provide a description for the machine learning flow (optional).
7. Click Create. This opens the Flow Editor that can be used to create a machine learning flow.

You have now imported an initial flow that we’ll explore in the rest of this tutorial.
